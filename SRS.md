## 1. Introduction
This section gives a description and a overview of everything included in this SRS document. Also, the purpose for this document is described and a list of abbreviations and definitions is provided.

### 1.1 Document Purpose
The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of the requirements for the "D.A.N.S" (Document administration & notification system) software. It will illustrate the purpose and complete declaration for the development of system. It will also explain system constraints, interface and interactions with the users. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a professor for its approval and a reference for developing the system for the development team.


### 1.2 Product Scope
This software is based in a notification system that emits an alert when an admin add a document. It will be implement using a web aplication.
The program emits a notification via e-mail when an admin uploead a document with lot of priorarity or when the user show some interest in a theme, previusly suscribed.
The software should be free to use for all the users.

### 1.5 Document Overview

The remainder of this document includes two more chapters and an appendixes. The second one provides an overview of the system functionality and system interaction with other systems. This chapter also introduces different types of stakeholders and their interaction with the system. Further, the chapter also mentions the system constraints andassumptions about the product.The third chapter provides the requirements specification in detailed terms and a description ofthe different system interfaces.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Perspective
<t traducir>
This software is a new product and self-contained. It come aout from the necesity of have a efficent system for the notification of the documents. The system should have a web portal where the documents and users will be administered and save in a Data Base. The documents should be upload by the admins and the system will notificate immediately.

### 2.2 Product Functions
<cambiar, traducir>

-listado funciones principales del software-

Con el portal web los admins podran administrar los documentos, ya sea subirlos, editaros, clasificarlos o eliminaros, mientras que los usuarios podran ver y buscar estos, suscribirse a temas de interes, y ademas seran notificados cuando corresponda. Tambien existira la posibilidad de ingresar como invitado, el cual solo podra ver y/o buscar las actas.



### 2.3 Product Constraints
<t traducir>
This section provide a list of the restrictions or limitations of the software, which are:

* The documents are only sorted by the cronological order that are upload.
* The admins only can tag registed users.
* The documents only can be searched by date, tag or labelled.
* The documents only can be .PDF, the original format of the University web.


### 2.4 User Characteristics

In this system there will be three types of users that interact with it:

| Name          | Permission    |                   What they can do                             | 
| :-----------: | :-----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: |                    
| Invited User  |   None        | See and browse for documents                                   | 
| User          |   None        | Invited User + subscribe to topics of interest and be notified |  
| Admin         |   All         | User + load, edit, classify and eliminate documents            |          


### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
<incompleto, traducir>

* El software funcionara para cualquier navegador ???
* El usuario deber√° tener conexion a internet



## 3. Requirements
<incompleto>
> This section specifies the software product's requirements.This section contains all of the functional and quality requirements of the system. It gives a detailed description of the system and all its features.


### 3.1 External Interfaces
<incompleto>
> This section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the system. It also gives a description of the hardware, software and communication interfaces and provides basic prototypes of the user interface.

* Name of item
* Source of input or destination of output
* Valid range, accuracy, and/or tolerance
* Units of measure
* Timing
* Relationships to other inputs/outputs
* Screen formats/organization
* Window formats/organization
* Data formats
* Command formats
* End messages

#### 3.1.1 User interfaces
<incompleto>
A first-time user of the "D.A.N.S" should see the log-in page when he enter in the web page, see Figure 1. If the user has not registered, he should be able to do that on the log-in page or enter like a invited user.
If the user is not a first-time user, he have to log-in and identify itself, see Figure 2. Every user should have a profile page where they can edit their e-mail address and password, see Figure 3. Also, the user can set the mobile application to his preferred language 

Now, both users continue to the next interface, see Figure 4. Here the user watch all the documents unread and he should be able to click in one of interest to expand it to watch it better. 

Another userface will be the page where the user can search and suscribe to some tags. See Figure 5. A list of tags is shown and the user can select some of them. Each tag should give the number of documents that are vinculated to it.


 
Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.

Could be further divided into Usability and Convenience requirements.

#### 3.1.2 Hardware interfaces
<incompleto>
Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.

#### 3.1.3 Software interfaces
<incompleto>
Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

#### 3.1.4 Comunication
<incompleto>

### 3.2 Functional
<incompleto>
> This section specifies the requirements of functional effects that the software-to-be is to have on its environment.

#### 3.2.1 User Class 1
<incompleto>
fotito UML ///Diagrama de clases////

#### 3.2.2 User Class 2
<incompleto>
Historias (Issues)


#### 3.3 Desing Requirements
<incompleto>
> This section states additional, quality-related property requirements that the functional effects of the software should present.

#### 3.3.1 Performance
<incompleto>
If there are performance requirements for the product under various circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual functional requirements or features.

### 3.4 Design Constraints
<incompleto>
Specify the requirements derived from existing standards or regulations, including:  
* Report format
* Data naming
* Accounting procedures
* Audit tracing

For example, this could specify the requirement for software to trace processing activity. Such traces are needed for some applications to meet minimum regulatory or financial standards. An audit trace requirement may, for example, state that all changes to a payroll database shall be recorded in a trace file with before and after values.
